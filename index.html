Firts, I hope you excuse me for my English, because it is not the best; I am from Costa Rica and I do not have a perfect domain of the English lenguage. Well, let me begin. I began my studies in 2010. I obteined my Bachelor degree in 2015, but now I continue studying, because I wish to be a great scientist and a great chemist teacher. I love teaching and learning.
